"""
Given three integers a, b, and n, such that gcd(a,n)=1 and n > 1,
the algorithm should return an integer x such that
0 <= x <= n-1, and
b / a = x (mod n) (that is, b = ax (mod n)).

The Extend Euclid's algorithm
The function extended_gcd(a,b) returns three values:
the greatest common divisor of a and b: d=gcd(a,b);
and two numbers x and y such that
d = ax + by
