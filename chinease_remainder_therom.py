"""
The Extend Euclid's algorithm
The function extended_gcd(a,b) returns three values:
the greatest common divisor of a and b: d=gcd(a,b);
and two numbers x and y such that
d = ax + by
"""
def ExtendedEuclid(a, b):
	# at least one of a and b shoud be greater than 0, and a >= b
	assert a >= b and b >= 0 and a + b > 0

	if b == 0:
		d, x, y = a, 1, 0
	else:
		(d, p, q) = ExtendedEuclid(b, a % b)
		x = q
		y = p - q * (a // b)

	assert a % d == 0 and b % d == 0
	assert d == a * x + b * y

"""
Chinese Remainder Theorem:
If gcd(a, b) == 1, so a and b are coprime
then, for any remainder ra mod a and any remainder rb mod b, there is an integer n:
n ≡ ra mod a
n ≡ rb mod b
If n1 and n2 are two such integers, then
n1 ≡ n2 mod ab
Proof:
gcd(a, b) = 1, so 1 = ax + by for some int x, y
ax ≡ 1 (mod b)
by ≡ 1 (mod a)
Thus ax corresponding to a pair of remainders (0, 1), and by corresponds to (1, 0)
Combine: (ra, rb) = ra(1, 0) + rb(0, 1)
n = raby + rbax
	≡ raby ≡ ra (mod a)
	≡ rbax ≡ rb (mod b)
